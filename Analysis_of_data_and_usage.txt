Within the 6 datasets analysed, these are the findings and how they can relate to the game

Subset used : 18th of November 2022 


C02 DATA [Subset used : 18th of November 2022 9:09AM to 9:09PM]:
  -Maximum value was 474 at 3:24pm
  -Minimum was 0 at 9:09am
  -mean was 219   [the value should flucutuate here for a while]
  This can correlate to the amount of people in the building and so the difficulty of the game at that point, i.e. at 3:24 there are the most people in the building 
  and so the most amount of appliances are being turned on etc.
  

HUMUDITY DATA [subset used : 18th of November 2022 9:08AM to 9:08PM]:
  -Max 43.68 at 11:28AM
  -Min 38.17 at 6:28PM
  -Mean is 40.65
  This will correlate to how many windows open, so the chances of windows opening should be highest between 11-1pm lets say and should be practically be 0 after 6:30
  other than that the value should hover around 40.65 so there should constantly be a window opening to be closed
  So all windows open == 43.68 (higher humidity as alot of people so)
  No windows open == 38.17 (i.e. all windows are closed and everyone is more or less gone home)
  
  
LIGHTS DATA [subset used : 18th of November 2022 9:04AM to 9:04PM]:
  -Max 2252.16 at 9:19AM so the max amount of lights are in at this time
  -Min is 7.99 at 8:34pm so basically everyone has left and all lights are off


Motion data [subset used : 9:12AM to 8:31PM]:
  The motion is highest at the start and end of every hour so increase activity at the start of each hour, so at the start of each hour, lets say a bunch of PC's in a 
  select number of rooms should all turn on and at the end of that hour, they should all be turned off

OPEN/CLOSE DATA [subset used : 9:23AM to 9:13PM]:
  -Not really sure how to use this data within the game so this will be passed within the game as Im not sure how to implement it
 
VIBRATIONS DATA [subset used : 7:50AM to 7:50PM]:
  Max : appears at 4pm and 6pm for some reason
  Min : several values as this data is between 0 and 1
  so maybe at 4 and 6pm maybe turn on several appliances like kettles and lights 


Computer Monitor : Will be turned on at the start of hours between 9 - 6, when a computer is on +1 to energy every 5 seconds, after an hour has passed the computer 
                   is able to be turned off as the user is done with it
                   

Window : Windows should open randomly, but if people arent in a room when they are open they need to be closed, windows open will cost +1 energy for every 5 seconds
         if a window is open AND a radiator is on +2 energy 

Empty plug socket : if a plug socket is on and being used +1 energy for every 10 seconds, if not being needs to be turned off


radiator : if a radiator is on +1 energy for every 5 seconds

taps  : for 3 seconds a tap is running +1 energy

kettle : Kettles will be on for a max of 5 minutes before being turned off automatically, Kettles only need to boil for 30 seconds before being fine, so turn off 
         after 30 seconds, they cost +1 energy for every 5 seconds [so have a max 60 energy points penalty if missed]

Light Switch : Every 5 seconds a light switch is on +1 to the energy, light switches should be turned off as soon as no one is in the room.

Different meters to be displayed
    1) Time
    2) Energy 
    3) Humidiy 
          -all windows closed == 43.68 (and thats good)
          -all windows open == 38.17 (and thats bad)
          -there are 3 windows on floor 1 and floor 2 and it goes as following
              -6 windows open == 38.17
              -5 window open== 39.09
              -4 windows open == 40.01
              -3 windows open == 40.93
              -2 windows open == 41.85
              -1 window open == 42.77
              -0 windows open == 43.68
    4) C02 Levels
          -should gradually rise from 0 to 474 and then go back down to 0, C02 rising shows more people are in the building and so more ugrency to run around and 
            check for points of interest
    5) Light Levels 
          -all lights are on == 2252.16
          -all lights off == 7.99
          -the mean is 579.09 so maybe each light turned on could add like 500 to the light level and each computer on can add 80.
